# ContractDiffuser
This is the online repository of the paper titled "An Expert-rules Guided Diffusion Model for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection".

## Dataset
The dataset we used is based on [Turn the Rudder](https://github.com/InPlusLab/ReentrancyStudy-Data), and we used [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) to mark the specific locations of the malicious contract vulnerability function blocks in the dataset.

We will soon release our dataset and the specific vulnerable function blocks that were annotated.
